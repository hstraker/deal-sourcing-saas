No. DealStack handles repetitive, time-consuming tasks so your team can focus on what humans do best: building relationships, negotiating deals, and making strategic decisions. Think of it as giving each team member a tireless assistant.

The AI is conversational and helpful, not pushy. Response rates are typically 40-60%, which is higher than phone calls (where 70%+ go to voicemail). Sellers appreciate the convenience of responding when it suits them.

### "How accurate is the BMV analysis?"
The system uses real sales data from PropertyData UK, which covers 30+ years of UK property transactions. It's the same data used by estate agents and surveyors. While no valuation is 100% certain, it's more accurate than manual comparables research.

### "Can I customize investor packs?"
Yes. You can create multiple templates for different investor types (cash buyers, developers, landlords) and customize branding, colors, and which metrics to show.

### "What happens if the AI makes a mistake?"
All AI conversations are monitored and can be reviewed. The system flags uncertain responses for human review. You always have final approval before making offers or sending to investors.
